config MTD_SPI_NOR_USE_4K_SECTORS
	bool "Use small 4096 B erase sectors"
	default y
	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

	  This enables support for the Quad SPI controller in master mode.

	  SPI NOR.

	  Enable support for the NXP LPC SPI Flash Interface controller.

	  SPIFI is a specialized controller for connecting serial SPI
	  Flash. Enable this option if you have a device with a SPIFI
	  controller and want to access the Flash as a mtd device.

config SPI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_FOUR_BYTE_MODE
	bool "Disable default four byte mode"
	default y
	help
	  Many flash memories supports 3 byte and 4 byte addressing. Linux spi
	  driver defaults to 4 byte addressing mode if flash size is more than
	   16M.
	  At power on, the flash will be in 3 byte mode by default and SOC tries
	  to read using 3 byte mode. If linux used soft reboot with 4 byte bode,
	  there will be conflict(SOC expects in 3 byte mode). This feature
	  enable the four byte mode when flash is accessed and puts back in to
	  three byte bode after completion of activity.
