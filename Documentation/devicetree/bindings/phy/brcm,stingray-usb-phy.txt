BROADCOM STINGRAY USB PHY

Required properties:
 - compatible : should be one of the listed compatibles
	- "brcm,sr-u3h-u2drd-phy"
	- "brcm,sr-u3drd-phy"
 - reg: offset and length of the PHY blocks registers
	two base address and length should be passed.
 - reg-names: should be from "drdu3","usb3h", "drdu2"
	"drdu3" for compatible string "brcm,sr-u3drd-phy"
	"usb3h" and "drdu2" for compatible string "brcm,sr-u3h-u2drd-phy"
 - address-cells: should be 1
 - size-cells: should be 0

Sub-nodes:
  Each port's PHY should be represented as a sub-node.
  Subnode names should be drdu3, usb3h and drdu2.

Sub-nodes required properties:
 - reg: the PHY port number
	port number should be as USB3H is 0, DRDU2 is 1 and DRDU3 is 0
 - phy-cells: generic PHY binding; must be 1
	The first argument of phy-cell represents the PHY mode in the requested node
	as either host mode or device mode.
	for host mode is 1 and device mode is 2.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties

Example:
	usbphy0: usb-phy@68500000 {
		compatible = "brcm,sr-u3drd-phy";
		reg = <0x68500000 0x100>;
		reg-names = "drdu3";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		usb0_phy0: phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <1>;
		};
	};

	usbphy1: usb-phy@68520000 {
		compatible = "brcm,sr-u3h-u2drd-phy";
		reg = <0x68510000 0x100>,
		      <0x68520000 0x100>;
		reg-names = "usb3h", "drdu2";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		usb1_phy0: phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <1>;
		};
		usb1_phy1: phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
